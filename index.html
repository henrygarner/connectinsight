            <h3>Startups &amp; Investors</h3>

            <p>If you run a start up or invest in them you will be
            only too aware of the risks. 3 in 4 startups fail. Most
            fail because the business becomes product focused and the
            market opportunity isn’t validated.</p>

            <p>Those that do grow explore the opportunity for their
            product by analysing competitors and alternatives and use
            this information in their commercial and product strategy.</p>

            <p>This doesn't hinder the fast pace of a startup as
            output is clear and actionable. You will be confident in
            creating strategies based on knowledge rather than
            assumption, turning your startup into a growth
            business.</p>

              <p>Existing audience measures don’t always answer the
                questions you have about your specific users. Digital
                brands create a lot of data, which tell us what users have
                done, but don’t tell us what they would <em>like</em> to
                do.</p>
              
              <p>We can help you get to know your users better by
                helping you make effective use of existing sources, or
                generate new insight. We use data and intelligence to
                create content strategies, usability, or commercial and
                product plans.</p>
