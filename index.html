            <p>Big data and large research projects are not what we’re

            right data and intelligence to answer them.</p>

            <p>Whether you have too much data or no market
            intelligence at all, we can help you derive the insight
            you need to execute your strategy with conviction.</p>

            <h4>STARTUPS &amp; INVESTORS</h4>

            <p>If you run a start up or invest in them you will be
            only too aware of the risks. 3 in 4 startups fail. Most
            fail because the business becomes product focused and the
            market opportunity isn’t validated.</p>

            <p>Those that grow, explore the opportunity for their
            product, analyse competitors and alternatives, and use
            this information in commercial and product strategy.</p>

            <p>This doesn't hinder the fast pace of a startup, as
            output is clear and actionable. You will be confident in
            creating strategies based on knowledge rather than
            assumption, turning your startup into a growth
            business.</p>

            <h4>DIGITAL BRANDS &amp; PUBLISHERS</h4>

            <p>Existing audience measures don’t always answer the
            questions you have about your specific users. Digital
            brands create a lot of data, which tell us what users have
            done, but don’t tell us what they would <em>like</em> to
            do.</p>

            <p>We can help you get to know your users better by
            helping you make effective use of existing sources, or
            generate new insight. We use data and intelligence to
            create content strategies, usability, or commercial and
            product plans.</p>
